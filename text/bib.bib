	1 Introduction
	
	
	
	In [1] it was proposed to use variational approach to super-resolution
	problem. Here we
	
	
	explain in details the results of implementation of some ideas from
	[1]. The paper is
	
	
	divided into two sections: first one devoted to spectrum-domain restoration
	and second
	
	
	one devoted to image domain super resolution, as it was described
	in [2]. We show that
	
	
	the new variational approach is a generalization of the approach proposed
	in [2]. The
	
	
	experimental results justify that the new variational approach (as
	it was theoretically
	
	
	predicted) adds robustness to additional noise to methods proposed
	in [2].
	
	
	
	2 Spectrum restoration
	
	
	
	2.1 Theoretical derivations
	
	
	
	The variatoional SR algorithm is formulated as follows [1].
	
	
	Imaging model:
	
	
	
	y = Bx+ ?,
	
	
	
	y ? Rm is observation, x ? Rn is unknown image, B is linear operator,
	 is noise, ?
	
	
	is noise variance.
	
	
	
	1. ( ?0
	
	
	?2
	
	
	BBT + Im?m)ut+1/2 =
	
	
	
	?0
	
	
	?2
	
	
	BBT y +B ·??t
	
	
	
	2. xt+1 = ??t ? ?0?2BT (ut+1/2 ? y) + (BT (BBT )?1B ? In?n)?t??t
	
	
	3. ?t+1 = Th?{?xt+1}
	
	
	
	Here ?t denotes sparse representation of x, ? and ? are transforms
	between image
	
	
	domain and sparse representations of x, ?t is artificially generated
	random excitation.
	
	
	
	In case of spectrum restoration, y is an upper left part of the DFT
	transform of
	
	
	initial image x. We consider case m = n/2. So, operator B = DF where
	F does FFT
	
	
	and D does selection of the upper-left submatrix. In this case, BBT
	= DFF TDT =
	
	
	DDT = Im?m, so the algorithm can be simplified, denoting k = ?0?2
	:
	
	
	
	1. ut+1/2 =
	
	
	k
	
	
	k+1y +
